| The platform's standard message templates. When a business connects its
| WhatsApp number these are submitted to its WhatsApp Business Account so
| invoices, reminders and receipts can be sent cold (outside the 24-hour
| service window). Businesses never write or submit templates themselves.
|
| `content` uses Crediping's named placeholders; Meta receives the same body
| with positional {{1}}, {{2}}… in the order the placeholders first appear
| (see WhatsAppCloudApi::payloadFor / MessageTemplate::placeholders).
| All are Utility-category, i.e. charged against the plan's included messages.
